# React Context Demo

This is a small React Native project that I used to demonstrate building your own ThemeProvider and withTheme HoC using the React Context API. 

## Run the example

```
git clone https://github.com/lsewilson/react-context-demo.git
cd react-context-demo
yarn
react-native run-ios
```

The code for this was originally taken from the [example](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat/tree/master/example) for the Gifted Chat library. 
## Screenshots 

The mode can be toggled on/off by pressing the moon icon in the top right corner.
